Code written while going through the New JavaScript tutorials

This is the source code for New Javascript tutorials. 
The .js files can be compiled and run using any IDE supporting Javascript or directly through the Command Line,
These are basic tutorial files I made while learning the basics of Javascript. 
If you have any suggestions or tips on how to write in Javascript, 
you can create a request and I'll look it up. 
Please comment the changes you made :)
